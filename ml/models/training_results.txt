Notes:
-----
- The model achieved excellent performance with over 91% accuracy on the test set
- Most important predictors are related to follicle counts, physical symptoms, and hormonal measurements
- Missing values were handled appropriately through imputation
- Feature engineering significantly improved the model's predictive power
