# Firebase Database Migration

This document outlines the migration from SQLite to Firebase Firestore in the Ovarian Cyst Support App.

## Key Changes

1. **Database Service Implementation**
   - Created `FirestoreDatabaseService` as a replacement for SQLite-based `DatabaseService`
   - Implemented all CRUD operations using Firestore

2. **Repository Pattern**
   - Added `FirestoreRepository<T>` generic class to abstract Firestore operations
   - Created specific repositories for different data types:
     - `SymptomEntryRepository`
     - `AppointmentRepository`
     - `TreatmentItemRepository`

3. **Migration Utilities**
   - Created `DatabaseMigrationService` to handle data transfer from SQLite to Firestore
   - Implemented batch processing to handle large data migrations efficiently
   - Added `MigrationService` to manage the migration flow in the app UI

4. **Configuration**
   - Updated `DatabaseConfig` to focus on Firestore optimization
   - Created `DatabaseServiceFactory` to provide the appropriate database implementation
   - Added shared preferences storage to track migration status

5. **User Experience**
   - Added migration screen to guide users through the transition
   - Implemented progress tracking during migration
   - Added fallback mechanisms and error handling

## Benefits of Firebase Firestore

1. **Real-time Updates**
   - Data changes are instantly reflected across all devices
   - Implemented streaming APIs for real-time UI updates

2. **Offline Support**
   - Configured Firestore for offline persistence
   - App continues to work without internet connection

3. **Scalability**
   - No local database size limitations
   - Better handling of large datasets

4. **Security**
   - User-specific data separation
   - Better access control with Firestore security rules

5. **Cross-Platform Consistency**
   - Same implementation works for web, mobile, and desktop

## Data Organization

Data is organized in Firestore collections:

- User-specific data stored under `/users/{userId}/{collection}`
- Global data stored directly in top-level collections
- Collections follow the same structure as the previous SQLite tables

## Migration Process

When a user first opens the app after updating:
1. The app checks if migration is needed
2. If needed, the migration screen is shown
3. Data is transferred collection by collection with progress updates
4. After successful migration, the app switches to using Firestore permanently

## Future Improvements

1. Add Firebase Functions for server-side processing
2. Implement more advanced querying capabilities
3. Add Firestore indexes for improved query performance
